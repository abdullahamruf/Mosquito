Mosquitoes, belonging to diverse species, play a significant role in ecological systems
and public health. Accurately, the identification and classification of mosquito species
are essential for a comprehensive understanding of their ecological roles, behaviours, and
evolutionary patterns. Some of the mosquito species act as vectors transmitting
different types of diseases. So, it is important to identify vector mosquitoes. While
numerous studies have attempted to classify the mosquito species and vector
mosquitoes, the existing works have some drawbacks. In this research, we conduct an
extensive study on mosquito species classification. Initially, we have employed the
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Subsequently, we have
introduced an ensemble technique. combining the three pre-trained models to make the
ensemble model, and we made four ensemble modes based on the combination formula.
All of the experiments were done using the Nadam and Adam optimizer, and we have
applied data augmentation techniques. We have evaluated our model using several
metrics. Among the four ensemble models, ensemble model 2 performed best, which
achieved 96% precision, recall, and f-score, which outperformed the previous research.
We have tested our model on another publicly available dataset, where we got 100%
accuracy. Additionally, our research focused on vector mosquito classification, which
aimed to identify and target the specific mosquito species responsible for transmitting
diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika. Our proposed model achieved 98.32% accuracy,
surpassing the existing model. Our results hold promise for improving our ability to
combat vector-borne diseases and ultimately fostering progress in both ecological and
public health domains, in addition to being a valuable contribution to the advancement
of mosquito species classification.
